			About Me
		</font>
	</h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		I am a Dominican American who was born in Manhattan, New York and raised in Bronx, New York. I was raised by two of the best people I can imagine. They taught me it's okay to be myself, to always remember who you are whenever things go bad,and much more. I dream to become a person who can pay them back for everything my parents have done for me. In hopes of achieving that dream, I try to work myself to my fullest potential everyday in and out of the school environment.
